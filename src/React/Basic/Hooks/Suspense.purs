-- | Suspend rendering until a result exists.
-- |
-- | *Note: Error and loading states are thrown to React! Don't forget
-- |   to implement a React error boundary and ensure `suspend` is
-- |   only called from a child of at least one `suspense` parent!*
-- |
-- | *Note: You probably shouldn't be using this function directly. It's
-- |   primarily for library authors to build abstractions on top of, as
-- |   it requires things like caching mechanisms external to the
-- |   component tree.*
-- |
-- | *Warning: React's Suspense API is still experimental. It requires
-- |   some manual setup as well as specific versions of React. The API
-- |   is also not final and these functions may change.*
